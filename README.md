# FFT-Image-processing-
This is a small hobby project undergoing to illustrate the working of image compression algorithms and edge detection mechanism in image processing.
Initially the FFT of an image is taken to analyse its frequency components in it. Then the fft matrix is manipulated cleverly to ignore the unecessary frequencies. This reduces the overall size of the image under inverse FFT.
